Match multiple pairs of the same 
color back-to-back to earn mana.

Each time you fill the mana bar
you will earn a wild. 

Match any card with your wild 
to remove that card.

You can store as many wilds
as you want, but each additional 
wild will require extra mana.

Wilds can be a tool or a trap.
Use them wisely!
