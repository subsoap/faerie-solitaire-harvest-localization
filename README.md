# Faerie Solitaire Harvest Localization

This is the community translation project for Faerie Solitaire Harvest. We want to translate our games to as many languages as possible so that as many people in the world can enjoy our games. Many people have asked to help us translate our games so we are trying to make it easier to contribute to any language. We are a commercial company and we do invest money into paying for translations but it can also be incredibly expensive so naturally we prioritize the largest languages. If we could afford to pay for every language to be done professionally we would but we are also a small, independent company so rely on our friends and community to help.

We translate store page text and game text. For game text there is general text and bulk text. General text includes things like text that goes on buttons, help screen text. Bulk text includes things such as character dialog, cutscenes, lore. Bulk text can be very large such as up to 20,000 words or more! Obviously by reading this text you could be exposed to spoilers and secrets better experienced first time through gameplay so beware.

We put any professional translation done into this git too. Even pros can make mistakes. You might find issues in the English text too and corrections for it are also accepted.

Sometimes new text is added for other languages. This missing text will show up as !KEY_NAME! in game until it has been translated into whatever langauge the user is using. We also get analytics data for missing keys to help remind us what needs to be updated.

If you are a contributor, you may want to watch this git and look for English changes to know when to contribute changes or additions to whatever language you are maintaining.

# How to contribute: 

You will need a GitHub account to contribute. Some basic git knowledge may be necessary. If you're new to git you can use the github desktop client to make it somewhat easier. https://desktop.github.com/

Text is first done in English and then translated into other languages. People who are gamers themselves and native speakers of the target language should be the only ones doing translations. The spirit of the text should not be changed ever, but localization does sometimes require changes. All text should follow US law at a minimum. If text offends people it should not be changed to be less offensive without first discussing the matter in an issue. If you have questions about specific text you can open an issue about it. If you are native speaker and notice an issue in the text but do not wish to help edit you can create an issue about the text problem.

As an example of what we don't want, if text says "cheeseburger" we don't want that to be localized to "sushi" it should be translated as well as it can to describe whatever the original thing is.

If font glyphs for your target language are not available in game please create an issue.

Currently RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi) are not supported but may be supported in the future.
